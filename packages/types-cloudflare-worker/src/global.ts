   *
   * Normally, Cloudflare computes the cache key for a request based on the

   * as if they were the same for caching purposes. For example, say your web
   * site content is hosted from both Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage – you
   * have the same content in both places, and you use a Worker to randomly
   * balance between the two. However, you don’t want to end up caching two
   * copies of your content! You could utilize custom cache keys to cache based
   * on the original request URL rather than the subrequest URL:

   * Notes:
   * * Each zone has its own private cache key namespace. That means that two
   *   workers operating within the same zone (even on different hostnames) may
   *   share cache using custom cache keys, but workers operating on behalf of
   *   different zones cannot affect each other’s cache.
   * * You can only override cache keys when making requests within your own
   *   zone, or requests to hosts that are not on Cloudflare. When making a
   *   request to another Cloudflare zone (e.g. belonging to a different
   *   Cloudflare customer), that zone fully controls how its own content is
   *   cached within Cloudflare; you cannot override it.
   * * URLs that are fetch()ed with a custom cache key cannot be purged using a
   *   URL purge. However you can use the Cache API and set a Cache Tag on the
   *   response object if you need to purge the URL.

 *
 * Workers KV is a global, low-latency, key-value data store. It supports exceptionally
 * high read volumes with low-latency, making it possible to build highly dynamic APIs
 * and websites which respond as quickly as a cached static file would.
 *
 * Workers KV is generally good for use-cases where you need to write relatively infrequently,
 * but read quickly and frequently. It is optimized for these high-read applications, only
 * reaching its full performance when data is being frequently read. Very infrequently read
 * values are stored centrally, while more popular values are maintained in all of our data
 * centers around the world.
 *
 * KV achieves this performance by being eventually-consistent. New key-value pairs are
 * immediately available everywhere, but value changes may take up to ten seconds to propagate.
 * Workers KV isn’t ideal for situations where you need support for atomic operations or where
 * values must be read and written in a single transaction.
 *
 * ref: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/kv
 *
 * Prerequisite
 * The first step is to bind one of your Namespaces to your Worker. This will make
